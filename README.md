sketchyPad: javascript library for drawing with a pen stylus on HTML5 canvas
============================================================================

creates an HTML 5 canvas of any size.

canvas listens for mouse move / pen events.

renders lines on canvas.

see example source (api will be changing)

I intend to wrap this code back into a jQuery plugin to turn any image or div into a 
"sketch-able" area.
